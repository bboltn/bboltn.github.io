From [Evernote](http://evernote.com/corp/news/password_reset.php):

"Evernote's Operations & Security team has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote Service.

As a precaution to protect your data, we have decided to implement a password reset. Please read below for details and instructions."

I love Evernote and these things happen from time to time.  There's bad people out there.  It's not clear that the hackers even got access to sensitive data.  Evernote did the right thing by resetting passwords.

Am I worried? Nah.  I use a unique password for everyone of my sites all stored in 1Password + Dropbox.
