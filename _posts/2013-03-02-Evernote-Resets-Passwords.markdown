From <a href="http://evernote.com/corp/news/password_reset.php">Evernote</a>:<br /><br />"Evernote's Operations &amp; Security team has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the Evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the Evernote Service.<br /><br />As a precaution to protect your data, we have decided to implement a password reset. Please read below for details and instructions."<br /><br />I love Evernote and these things happen from time to time. &nbsp;There's bad people out there. &nbsp;It's not clear that the hackers even got access to sensitive data. &nbsp;Evernote did the right thing by resetting passwords.<br /><br />Am I worried? Nah. &nbsp;I use a unique password for everyone of my sites all stored in <a href="http://www.fountaincitycode.com/2011/06/security-in-bolton-house-hold.html">1Password&nbsp;+ Dropbox</a>.
