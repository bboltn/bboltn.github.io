- My old desktop was in desperate need of replacement. I ordered a Dell Studio 16 XPS, but then it was never shipped to me. It kept getting delayed again and again. So I canceled my order and ought a Macbook Pro instead.
- I did a presentation on SQL Injection at the local SQL Server club. I can't say it was well received. I wasn't too prepared for it.
- I setup up a complete backup system. I've got a bootable backup and time machine backup on an external harddrive. The HDD is attached to an airport extreme. This means everything gets backed up even if I'm not at my desk. In addition I've setup Carbonite to do offsite backups. This has been going for 2 weeks now and its uploaded 47.36GB so far.
- I bought an Airport Express mainly for the wifi extender features. Turns out it also has a feature called Airtunes. I can stream itunes to a set of external speakers attached to the Airport Express. I also use a program called Airfoil to stream any sound source to the speakers.
- I'm currently studying Objective-C. I hope to create a simple workout tracking program for the ipod touch. I've used several and I've never really liked any of them.
- Updating tom Graffagnino's website.

Objective-C scares the heck outta me. I haven't done any non-managed code development since College and even then it wasn't production quality.
