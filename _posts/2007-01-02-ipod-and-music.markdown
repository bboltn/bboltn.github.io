Here's my setup:

- I use gtkpod to load my ipod
- Amarok to listen to music on my computer
- EasyTag to label my music
- Sound Juicer (and Windows media player) to rip music
- Streamripper to rip internet radio <--- very cool program
- last.fm to share music

I could be using one program (windows media player) on windows to this but that would be easy.
