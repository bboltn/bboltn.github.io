Here's my setup:<br />I use gtkpod to load my ipod<br />Amarok to listen to music on my computer<br />EasyTag to label my music<br />Sound Juicer (and Windows media player) to rip music<br />Streamripper to rip internet radio <--- very cool program<br />last.fm to share music<br /><br />I could be using one program (windows media player) on windows to this but that would be easy.
