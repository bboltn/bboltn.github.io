<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Former co-workers and future co-workers, please don't get offended by this post.  After you read this, you'll know the type of person I don't want to work with.  This may or may not be you.  It's OK if it is you.  I have plenty of friends that I wouldn't want to work with, but I sure do enjoy going out for a drink or having fun with this friend.</p><p><a href="http://www.fountaincitycode.com/2010/10/turn-of-events.html">Original post.</a></p>
