[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) was a life saver for a new vim user.  It provides a fuzzy file search.  I came from Sublime Text 2 which had a similar feature and I really liked it. 

Ultimately I ended up using [NERDTree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658) more.  I found out about this after CtrlP.  It's just a file explorer -- which seems rather boring -- but in the context of vim, it's a great tool.

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is a color scheme that just looks cool.  It looks great when I launch vim from terminal or MacVim.

[Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) is a package manager for installing all the above.

Here's my [.vimrc](https://github.com/progrn/my_vimrc) on github.
