I figure if I record all streaming music from idobi Radio for the next year I might need a bigger harddrive.

idobi Radio is an internet radio station that streams at 128 kbps or 0.015625 MBps 

0.015625 MBps * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 365 days = 492 750 gigabytes = 481.201172 terabytes

[I am going to need a lot of these.](http://cgi.ebay.com/Western-Digital-1-TB-Terabyte-My-BookPro-II-Harddrive_W0QQitemZ130044269970QQcmdZViewItem)
