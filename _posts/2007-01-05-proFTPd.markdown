I just setup a proFTPd server on my Ubuntu machine. I can connect via [net2ftp.com](http://www.net2ftp.com/) and I can connect locally using the gFTP client. But I can't connect from the windows machine on my network or from a windows machine externally. I don't think it's OS related. Most likely a setting on in the ftp client. 

Just in case you happen to be a FTP wizard leave a comment and give me some ideas.
