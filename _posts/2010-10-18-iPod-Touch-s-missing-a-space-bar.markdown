title: iPod Touch is missing a space bar

I've been using my iPod Touch since 2007.  I just saw today that when entering a URL in Safari, the space bar is missing.  Spaces are invalid URL characters.  Instead of giving the user more features (like a space bar) Apple decided to prevent the user from doing something wrong.

This focus and attention to detail at Apple is incredible.

Speaking of Incredible, Jackie's HTC Incredible lets you enter spaces in the web browser.  I'm not sure if this was a decision by HTC or Google.  I hope it wasn't Google.  They are an internet company and should know what a proper URL looks like.

It wouldn't surprise me if it was Google though.  Google is motivated by features.  Apple is motivated by what's right.

[Looks like this has been a feature since 2007 and I wasn't the first to notice.](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/492-iphones-disappearing-spacebar)
