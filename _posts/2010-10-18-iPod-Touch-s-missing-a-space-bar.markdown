title: iPod Touch s missing a space bar

<p>I've been using my iPod Touch since 2007.  I just saw today that when entering a URL in Safari, the space bar is missing.  Spaces are invalid URL characters.  Instead of giving the user more features (like a space bar) Apple decided to prevent the user from doing something wrong.</p><p>This focus and attention to detail at Apple is <strong>incredible</strong>.</p><p>Speaking of <strong>Incredible</strong>, Jackie's HTC Incredible lets you enter spaces in the web browser.  I'm not sure if this was a decision by HTC or Google.  I hope it wasn't Google.  They are an internet company and should know what a proper URL looks like.</p><p>It wouldn't surprise me if it was Google though.  Google is motivated by features.  Apple is motivated by what's right.</p><p>....</p><p><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/492-iphones-disappearing-spacebar">Looks like this has been a feature since 2007 and I wasn't the first to notice.</a></p>
