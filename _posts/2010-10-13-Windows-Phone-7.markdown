<p>I find it interesting that Microsoft is touting their phone as the better designed and more productive phone.  "get what you want and then get going". Check out some of their commercials to see what I mean.</p><p>Apple is positioned as the platform with tons of apps.  That used to be Microsofts line.  Now Microsoft is stealing Apple's lines.  "We don't have as many apps but we have the ones you need - and they are better."</p><p>....</p><p>I'm excited about WP7.  The interface seems slick and very different.  Not just another iPhone clone (like Android).  I lusted after the iPhone for some time now.  Too bad it's taking Apple forever to get iPhone to verizon.  I am not really interested in it anymore.</p><p>I just might get a WP7 phone.  I hope it works with my Mac.</p>
