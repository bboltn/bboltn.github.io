title: How to Uninstall Infinite Labs Keep Afloat

<p>I searched all over the web for how to uninstall <a href="http://infinite-labs.net/afloat/">Keep Afloat</a>, but came up with nothing.  It is not a traditional application or service; it is a <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a> plugin.</p><p>Uninstalling it is easy.  Open up Finder and navigate to ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL.  Here you will find the Keep Afloat plugin.  Just delete this file and Keep Afloat is gone.</p><p>If you don't using SIMBL, then you can uninstall that too.  Go to the SIMBL <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">homepage</a>, download SIMBL, and run the uninstaller in the ZIP file.</p>
