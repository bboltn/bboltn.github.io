The following code is used by the aspx page to receive and parse the input 
string. This code assumes the input is meant to be interpreted as a string. 
The string could be xml or just text. I send plain text in previous 
javascript samples.

{% highlight csharp %}
//I use this page to receive and parse any packets sent to my aspx page
public string GetInputStream(){
    long length = Request.InputStream.Length;
    byte [] b = new byte[length];
    Request.InputStream.Read(b,0,(int)length);
    string inputstream = string.Empty;
    foreach(byte by in b)
        inputstream += Convert.ToChar(by).ToString();

    return inputstream; 
}

//you call the code like this
string input = GetInputStream();
{% endhighlight %}
