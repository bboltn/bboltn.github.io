<p>I know absolutely nothing about video, video encoding, video resolutions, video streaming, or anything else video.  I am a self professed idiot when it comes to video.  And this is why I love Apple...</p><p>I copy a video onto my hard drive.  I go to youtube.com and try uploading it. FAIL.  Couldn't convert the video it says.  Youtube recommends using a video converter and it provides a few links.  I have to leave in an hour for dinner so I'm thinking that maybe I should wait until later to do this.</p><p>And then I remember about this program I have called iMovie.  I have NEVER it used before.  I open it up, click New Project, Import the video, Click Share &gt; Youtube, and then BOOM.  Its on youtube.  Holy f*cking shit.  I went from noob to expert in 30 seconds.  Or at least it seems that way.  I still don't know how any of it works.  But it DOES work and that's all I care about.</p><p>If you want to check it out, just keep scrolling.  You should also check out <a href="http://www.everythingawesome.org">http://www.everythingawesome.org</a>.  It's a new computer and technology club I'm starting in Columbus.  Please attend if you are in town.</p><p> </p><iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cvGhbxacaKc" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe>
