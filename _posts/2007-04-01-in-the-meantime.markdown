I installed ruby on rails, php, mysql and lighttpd on my computer.  Yup.  I didn't do anything with them...  I just installed* them.  What motivated me to do this?  I saw a really cool demo of ruby on rails and It got me interested.  See my next post for details.  <br /><br />(*installing things in linux is a matter of finding a blog or forum that provides instructions - that or just know what the heck you're doing)
