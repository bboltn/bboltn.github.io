Do you notice that post on january 28th? Yeah, I still haven't done it. I have been waffling back and forth on either wireless or wired networking. My last wireless installation under Ubuntu was very difficult and I couldn't even tell you why it works. I just know it does. 

I would rather have a wired file server but then I would have to run a cable from my modem through the walls and into the attic.
