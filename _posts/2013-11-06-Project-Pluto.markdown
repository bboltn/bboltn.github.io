I worked on an inventory management project with my friend over the summer.&nbsp; It was a three person team: Two Developers and one product/sales guy.&nbsp; The product manager left the project and it wasn't a project I was passionate enough to continue working on.<br /><br />Either way, I learned a new cool framework, Meteor, and I brushed up on my Javascript.&nbsp; You can view my work here:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/progrn/projectpluto/">https://github.com/progrn/projectpluto/</a>
