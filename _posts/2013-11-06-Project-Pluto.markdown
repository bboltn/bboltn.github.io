I worked on an inventory management project with my friend over the summer.  It was a three person team: Two Developers and one product/sales guy.  The product manager left the project and it wasn't a project I was passionate enough to continue working on.

Either way, I learned a new cool framework, Meteor, and I brushed up on my Javascript.  You can view my work here:
