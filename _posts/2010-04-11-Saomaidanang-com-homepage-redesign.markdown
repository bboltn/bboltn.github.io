I just finished up another <a href="http://saomaidanang.com/newsite.php">site</a>. <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/tXjcUiaZbejsJQjosIPwkT_krfPU8MkhdCR00Eq-Qqo?feat=directlink">You can view a screenshot here.  </a>This was just a homepage redesign and a little bit of php.  Don't judge the site by the pages it links to.  I'm not responsible for that.<br /><br />Even though it was just one page, it took about the same amount of effort as a multi-page site.  Every site, whether its many pages or one, has a certain amount of overhead.  Mocking up the site in Photoshop and then creating a static version is the same regardless of the number of pages.<br /><br />It turned out great and I was really happy with it.  I had a few challenges.  The site was in Vietnamese.  You have to be very careful about the encoding and DOCTYPE of a site if you want the characters to display correctly.  I also did a small amount of php - a language I knew nothing about.  I learned enough to query the phpBB database and get the most recent posts.<br /><br />I also used the Blueprint CSS framework.  It worked out well.  You still need to know CSS to use it - you just don't need to be an expert.
