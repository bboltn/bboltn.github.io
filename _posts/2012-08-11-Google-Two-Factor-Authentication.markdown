Credit card companies are paranoid. &nbsp;It's part of the industry culture - as it should be. &nbsp;You want them to be extremely protective of your credit card information. &nbsp;After working at one such company for six years it starts to rub off on you.<br /><br />Sometime ago I started using <a href="/2011/06/15/security-in-the-bolton-household.html">1Password</a>&nbsp;and I did a few other things to protect our computers. &nbsp;Since that time, I've added<br /><br /><ul><li>full disk encryption to my laptop,&nbsp;</li><li>I'm running all of our computers as non-administrative accounts,&nbsp;</li><li>I dumped Carbonite for backup and use Dropbox now</li><li>I added virus software to my Mac,</li><li>I have hidden my network SSID,</li><li>and I still use 1Password to keep my passwords.</li></ul><br />After <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/">Mat Honan</a> was hacked, I added Google two-factor authentication to my account, something you've surely read about if you've been keeping up with the story.<br /><br />It is really easy to setup (just do it now) and it is another layer of security on top of everything else. &nbsp;Whenever you access Google from another machine, it asks for your password, and it also texts/calls you with a security code that you must enter. &nbsp;Once the machine is authorized, you don't have to do this again.<br /><br />Turning on Two-factor auth gives you another neat feature. &nbsp;I've given access to many applications so that they could use my Google account. &nbsp;I've lost count of them all and I cannot really be sure what has access or not. &nbsp;Two-Factor auth has a neat feature &nbsp;called&nbsp;Application&nbsp;Specific passwords. &nbsp;It lets you give custom throw away passwords to any app or website that wants access to your Google stuff. &nbsp;Don't use that product anymore? &nbsp;Just login to Google and revoke the access. &nbsp;There's a nice listing of everything that's using Google.<br /><br />If someone really wants to get into your system, they probably can. &nbsp;I know this and I am pretty sure I could get hacked by anyone with the skills and if they cared to do so. &nbsp;Here's the good part: &nbsp;Just make sure you're more secure than the people around you. &nbsp;If a criminal wants in, she'll pick the easy target over the hard target all things being equal. &nbsp;If you've setup things like I have, then they are going to have a harder time than someone using "Password" for their password. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="/images/Screen+Shot+2012-08-11+at+1.35.46+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="/images/Screen+Shot+2012-08-11+at+1.35.46+PM.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">1Password Login Screen</td></tr></tbody></table><br />
