Writing these blogs is a stream of consciousness.  I can't write and don't want to write anyother way.  I end up editing myself too much. And I'd end up not writing these things.  I'm taking the same attitude to blogging as I did running.  Just do it.  Eventually you'll get good at it and then you can focus on form, speed, distance, grammar, and style.

As a result of this fast past, get it done attitude, I usually don't put links in my articles.  Finding the link and adding a hyperlink would pull me away from writing.

I figure you can just Google it.  If you're using Chrome, just select the text and click "Search Google for 'blah'"
