Blogger just wasn't fitting my needs anymore.  I wanted more control over my design and I really liked using Markdown for my editing.
I started researching static site generators.  Jekyll looked good with an added bonus that I could get it hosted on Github.  Win Win.

Nearly a year ago I decided to create [this program](https://github.com/progrn/csb) that would convert my blogger templates to a
generic XML file.  With minimal tweaking I got it to export markdown files instead.

That got me 80% of the way.  I went post by post and reviewed them for formatting issues.
