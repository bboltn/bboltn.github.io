title: Appliances go

I abandoned general purpose computers to do tasks that could be done with applicances instead.

I got rid of my file/print server. I replaced it with a airport extreme + 2 TB external drive.  End result:  More reliable setup. Nothing crashes.  I don't need any expert knowledge of networking or servers.  AND its cheaper.

I got rid of my home media center pc.  I replaced it with a Roku box.  Roku's got the 10 foot interface.  Comes with a nice little remote.  Easy to use.  AND its cheaper, quieter, more reliable.

I got rid of my desktop.  I replaced it with a Macbook Pro.  Its cheaper and more reliable.  Plus its portable. I love it.

....

Don't use the hammer to solve every solution.  ﻿Computers were my hammer.  My home media center and file/print server were evidence of that.  I spent over $1000 on computers that did not solve the problem.  The final solution (roku/airport/external drive) cost a third of the computer solution - ohh yeah and it actually worked.
