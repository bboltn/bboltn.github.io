<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Picstogo</span>.net ran on a shared hosting platform from October 30<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">th</span> to March 1st.  Shared hosting just did not cut it.  Not much of a surprise really considering what we did.<br /><br />We were<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>uploading 400 files at around 2-3MB each, zipping them up, and downloading this 1GB+ file.  Once that finished, we'd run the process again, but in the other direction.<br /><br />Shared hosting imploded with this demand.<br /><br />My client sprung for the dedicated server plan back in January.  I spent the month doing research and getting a good deal.  We decided to go with <a href="http://www.rackmounted.com/"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Rackmounted</span></a>.  They offered a few things others didn't for the price:<br /><br /><ol><li>Windows 2008</li><li>Inexpensive backup</li><li>No setup fee</li></ol><br />The past month I've setup SMTP, FTP, ASP.NET <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">MVC</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">IIS</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">SQL</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">DNS</span>, and a few other acronyms. The migration was officially done as of this morning when the last bit of <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">DNS</span> finally pointed to the new <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">IP</span>.<br /><br />The server is much faster than shared hosting.  Page load and download speed are noticeable faster.  I am downloading at 700Kb.  Considering this site is all about download and upload, that's a big improvement for customers.
