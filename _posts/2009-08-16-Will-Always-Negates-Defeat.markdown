My big message for today is:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Buy or borrow code when you can.  </span>The site I'm working on now is built around uploading large quantities of files (400+).  I'm not going to build a file upload control.  I bought one from these <a href="http://ajaxuploader.com/">kind folks.</a><br /><br />It's all these guys do.  They make this one very excellent asp.net control that you can use to upload files.  In addition, they provide code samples for every conceivable scenario in C# and VB and in ASP.NET Classic and ASP.NET <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">MVC</span>.  Wonderful guys and gals they are.<br /><br />And whats a website without a <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">login</span> and user management?  For that I am using the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MvcMembership">ASP.NET <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">MVC</span> Membership Starter Kit</a> for managing users.  ASP.NET 2 has really good classes that help you do all the CRUD associated with users.  But these guys take it one step further.... they built an entire sample site, assemblies that encapsulate complexity, and some great samples.  Thank you.<br /><br />I'm full of love today.  My last <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">shoutout</span> goes to <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">ASPdotNetFAQ</span>.  I was getting this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Failed%20to%20generate%20a%20user%20instance%20of%20SQL%20Server%20due%20to%20a%20failure%20in%20starting%20the%20process%20for%20the%20user%20instance&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw&amp;start=0">error </a>when connecting to a local database.  Here's the <a href="http://aspdotnetfaq.com/Faq/fix-error-Failed-to-generate-a-user-instance-of-SQL-Server-due-to-a-failure-in-starting-the-process-for-the-user-instance.aspx">solution</a>.<br /><br />This post title comes from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_W.A.N.D._%28The_Will_Always_Negates_Defeat%29">Flaming Lips song</a>.  I just discovered them this weekend and I felt that title was appropriate.
