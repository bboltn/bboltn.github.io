I've been spending time reading [Introduction to Objective-C Programming Language](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001163). I like learning new programming languages and I want to develop for the ipod touch (not iphone because I don't have one).


Today I read about:

- Categories - reminds me of extension methods in c#
- Associative references - over my head
- Fast Enumeration - aka For/Each statement
- Selectors - over my head

"Over my head" sums up my experience so far. The only topics I'm groking are things I already know about (categories, fast enumeration). Anything new is just beyond me at the moment. I'd like to finish reading this one and then move onto [Object-Oriented Programming with Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/oop_objc/Introduction/Introduction.html).
