I've been playing D&D with my wife, Jackie, this week.  I like keeping a log of the adventures and a map of the places we've been.  Jackie reached a milestone and her characters both reached level 2.  It was getting late and I was tired, but I wanted to finish up clean for the night.  I decided to upgrade her characters, fill in my log, and draw a map on my computer.  After leveling up I attempted to print the character sheets.  

If you know me and printers you know that I hate them.  What I really mean is that I hate the engineers that design printers - you are terrible at your job - just quit and do something else for a living.

After a grueling 30 minutes and many curse words, it finally bent to my will and printed the sheets.  It went from a fun happy night to a terrible-I-hate-everything night.

With the log done, map made, and sheets printed, I am ready to go to bed.  I should have stopped, but I just couldn't leave a good thing alone.  I see that I have two different folders on my computer with D&D documents.  I decide to merge the old one with the new one.  In Windows when you overwrite a folder with another folder it merges the folders.  I am a Windows guy by trade so this is what I expect.  In OS X it deletes the old folder and put the new one in its place. 

In other words, It fks you.

> Can you at least take me to a grease monkey so I can at least get lubed up before you fk me. Or at at least a little courtesy lick. How about a little courtesy lick next time you try to f**k me?
Yeah, OS X, how about a courtesy lick?  I came to expect this from my Printer, but you Mac OS X??? YOU TOO?!

Yep, I just lost all my character sheets, maps, and log for our entire adventure - they were replaced by some old D&D files that I really didn't need!  This sinking depression came over me and I thought I just might cry.  

I sat there thinking "there must be a way to get this back."  But the Mac recycle bin didn't have anything.  I was at a total loss for any solution.

I walked away from the computer in a shocked WTF moment - A serious tragedy just occurred (I blame the printer).  I had no more anger in me - it was spent on the printer.  I was just slack jaw amazed that this happened.

If I did one smart thing it was storing all of this in my Dropbox folder. Guess what!  Dropbox has a recycle bin.  It had already backed up my documents before I could delete them.  HECK YEAH!  Elation!

p.s. It's our 5th anniversary as wife and husband.  I love you Jackie!
