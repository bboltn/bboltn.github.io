[Workflow](https://my.workflow.is) is a new app from DeskConnect.  Here's the big idea:
It lets you create apps on your phone using your phone.  No Xcode required, 
no app store, just you and your phone creating apps.  It is insanely powerful.

You create apps using a workflow editor.  You can drag and drop different actions
onto the workflow screen.  There are so many options to choose from.  Look up 
addresses, download files, get current location, open other apps, and more.

Once you've created your workflow you can then add it to your home screen with
a custom icon, color, and text.

If you can't think of any apps to create or where to start they have a whole gallery 
of pre-made workflows to choose from.  I used these as inspiration and base
for the workflows I made.
