A big fan of Evernote.  My friend Greg recommended it as a good way to save online receipts.  My friend Jennifer recommended it for no specific reason - she was just really enthusiastic about it.

I've been using it alot lately for studying Sharepoint 2010 videos on Channel 9.  I made a Todo list on my ipod this morning (using the evernote app).  I tried checking it at Starbucks and it couldn't pull up the list - evernote doesn't provide offline notes for free.

I liked the service so much and what this company was doing I decided to purchase the service for one year.

....

One of my favorite programs and companies, XMarks, is going out of business.  They could not figure out a way to make a profit.  I would pay for this service.  I signed their online pledge saying as much.

I would hate for Evernote to go the way XMarks is headed.  Purchasing it can hopefully keeps these guys and gals afloat.
