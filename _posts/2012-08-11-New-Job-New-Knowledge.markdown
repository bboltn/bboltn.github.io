I am moving away from SharePoint development and SharePoint administration to a full-time Web Development job.  This is where I really wanted to be for a long time and I am very excited about this new job.

I am working on an ASP.NET MVC 3 application.  It uses NHibernate and jQuery extensively.  There's also a little bit of Ninject and Moq.
I've been there for just a week and a half, but I've already learned so much and learned that I know so little.  I'll be tackling these technologies over the next few months, and hopefully writing about them as well.

....

I'm excited about the opportunity to be focus solely on programming.  Every job I've had up until now, pulls me in a million different directions and it's difficult to focus and get that deep knowledge in a subject.
