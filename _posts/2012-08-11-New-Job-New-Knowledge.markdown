I am moving away from SharePoint development and SharePoint administration to a full-time Web Development job. &nbsp;This is where I really wanted to be for a long time and I am very excited about this new job.<br /><br />I am working on an ASP.NET MVC 3 application. &nbsp;It uses NHibernate and jQuery extensively. &nbsp;There's also a little bit of Ninject and Moq.<br />I've been there for just a week and a half, but I've already learned so much and learned that I know so little. &nbsp;I'll be tackling these technologies over the next few months, and hopefully writing about them as well.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />I'm excited about the opportunity to be focus solely on programming. &nbsp;Every job I've had up until now, pulls me in a million different directions and it's difficult to focus and get that deep knowledge in a subject.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />
