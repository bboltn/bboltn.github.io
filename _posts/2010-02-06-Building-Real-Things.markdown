My Dad came over today to help me put in a shower floor and shower surround. Today we finished removing the tub, installing the pipes, and installing the shower floor. Tomorrow we will put up the shower walls.

I love doing this stuff with my Dad. I've lived in this house for 4 years and I really did not understand all the ins-and-outs of how the house plumbing works. Working on my home gives me a deeper understanding of the place I live in. It is very satisfying work.
