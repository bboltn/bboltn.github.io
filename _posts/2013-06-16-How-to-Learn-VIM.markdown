A few weeks back I committed code to Bitbucket, but didn't specify a commit message.  Git dropped my into vim.  I was lost and had to start looking up commands.  This was the catalyst for me to learn vim.  Here's what I tried:

- [vim adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/)
- [interactive vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)
- [beautiful vim cheat sheet](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-cheat-sheet-poster)

I even went so far as to print out two copies of the cheat sheet -- A3 and Letter sizes -- and get them laminated at Kinkos.  They are a good reference and the A3 size looks awesome on my desk.

In the last week I came across [shortcutFoo](https://www.shortcutfoo.com/).  They teach you shortcuts for a bunch of editors (vim, emacs, intelliJ) using interval training.  I am actually really learning the shortcuts.  I was so happy with my progress with the vim tutorial, that I added command line and git training.
