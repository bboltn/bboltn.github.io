A few weeks back I&nbsp;committed&nbsp;code to Bitbucket, but didn't specify a commit message. &nbsp;Git dropped my into vim. &nbsp;I was lost and had to start looking up commands. &nbsp;This was the catalyst for me to learn vim. &nbsp;Here's what I tried:<br /><br /><a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">vim adventures</a><br /><a href="http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html">interactive vim tutorial</a><br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-cheat-sheet-poster">beautiful vim cheat sheet</a><br /><br />I even went so far as to print out two copies of the cheat sheet -- A3 and Letter sizes -- and get them&nbsp;laminated&nbsp;at Kinkos. &nbsp;They are a good reference and the A3 size looks awesome on my desk.<br /><br />In the last week I came across <a href="https://www.shortcutfoo.com/">shortcutFoo</a>. &nbsp;They teach you shortcuts for a bunch of editors (vim, emacs, intelliJ) using interval training. &nbsp;I am actually <i>really</i>&nbsp;learning the shortcuts. &nbsp;I was so happy with my progress with the vim tutorial, that I added command line and git training.
