[Astronomer's found a diamond about 4000 km across.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3492919.stm)

Pretty cool. I like the last two paragraphs.

> Astronomers expect our Sun will become a white dwarf when it dies 5 billion years from now. Some two billion years after that, the Sun's ember core will crystallise as well, leaving a giant diamond in the centre of the solar system.

> Our Sun will become a diamond that truly is forever," says Metcalfe.

Let's not mention the fact that we'll all be really really dead.
