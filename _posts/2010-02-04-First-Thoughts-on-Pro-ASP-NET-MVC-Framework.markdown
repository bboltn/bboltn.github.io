title: First Thoughts on Pro ASP NET MVC Framework

I've been reading <a href="http://apress.com/book/view/1430210079">Pro ASP.NET MVC Framework</a>.  I haven't finished it yet but I'm already going to recommend it.<br /><br />The author, Steven Sanderson, knows what he's talking about.  Here's how the book breaks down:  The first 3 chapters consist of an introduction to core MVC concepts and some design patterns.  The next 3 chapters are a step by step guide on building an online store.  I love this part.  I learn by doing and this application is a real world application.  I definitely see myself taking code from this app and using in <a href="http://go.picstogo.net/">Picstogo</a>.  The rest of the book is a deep dive into ASP.NET MVC specific concepts.  I haven't gotten past chapter 10 yet.<br /><br />The best way to read this book is start with the store application chapters.  When you're not around a computer, read the rest of the book.  I find this very valuable. I'm getting an even mix of theory and application.<br /><br />I'm not done reading yet, I hope hope hope to finish this book.  I am really bad about reading half of a technical book and starting another one.  Let's just say that I'm reading the good parts.
