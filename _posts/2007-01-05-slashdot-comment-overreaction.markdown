<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/07/01/06/0140251.shtml">Toyota creating in-vehicle alcohol detection system</a><br /><br />By reading the comments you would think that Toyota's got a gun to their head forcing this technology into every car. <br /><br />Most people missed the point of the article.  It's just a prototype.  This isn't what's going to be put in cars.<br /><br />To summarize the article, "hey man look at this technology toyota's making. isn't it swell?"<br /><br />To exagerate the article, "omgfg roflcopter!!! Those @##$*!3s"
