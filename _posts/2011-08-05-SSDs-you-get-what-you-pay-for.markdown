My 2.5inch 160GB SSD costs $1.875 per GB. A [2.5 inch 160GB 5400RPM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152093) costs $0.218 per GB.

Woah, that's expensive!  That SSD is 8.6 times the cost of the HDD.  O  but wait... take a gander at this little picture:

My SSD score is 8 times that of my old HDD.  Which nearly matches the price difference. I'd attribute that extra  0.6 to additional reliability that SSDs provide.
