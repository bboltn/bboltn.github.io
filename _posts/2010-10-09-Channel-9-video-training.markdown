I've been watching the channel 9 videos for sharepoint 2010.  Loads of amazing content - all free.

Sitting in a coffee shop while watching videos has been really productive for me. I'm out of the house and around people.  I am away from all my distracting toys. There's just the right amount of noise and people to keep me focused.

Its the Goldilocks workplace.
