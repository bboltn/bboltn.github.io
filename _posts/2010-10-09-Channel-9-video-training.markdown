<p>I've been watching the channel 9 videos for sharepoint 2010.  Loads of amazing content - all free.</p><p><strong>Videos<br /></strong><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Learn/Courses/SharePoint2010Developer">http://channel9.msdn.com/Learn/Courses/SharePoint2010Developer﻿</a></p><p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Learn/Courses/SharePoint2010Developer"></a><strong>My Notes<br /></strong><a href="http://www.evernote.com/pub/brianbolton/sharepointtraining">http://www.evernote.com/pub/brianbolton/sharepointtraining﻿</a></p><p>....</p><p>Sitting in a coffee shop while watching videos has been really productive for me. I'm out of the house and around people.  I am away from all my distracting toys. There's just the right amount of noise and people to keep me focused.</p><p>Its the Goldilocks workplace.</p>
