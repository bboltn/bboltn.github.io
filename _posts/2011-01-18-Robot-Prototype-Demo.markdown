I'm trying to organize a semi-regular meeting for computer nerds.  Our first meeting will be January 24th, Monday, from 6-7:30 PM at the Columbus Public Library on Macon Rd, in the Synovus Room.

### Presenters:

Fred Johnson and Geoffrey Shoultz, built a 4 wheeled rock climbing robot.  You can control it via the internet and it stream video.  Really awesome project.  I hope you can attend.
